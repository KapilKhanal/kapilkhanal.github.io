## Abstract

Understanding and predicting wave-structure interactions is central to the design and operation of offshore systems—from floating wind turbines and wave energy converters to autonomous marine platforms. Traditionally, these interactions are modeled using boundary element method (BEM) solvers based on linear potential flow theory. However, a major limitation of existing BEM solvers is their inability to provide sensitivities (derivatives) of hydrodynamic quantities with respect to design variables such as geometry, wave frequency, or device layout. These sensitivities are essential for enabling modern workflows in design optimization, control co-design, uncertainty quantification, and physics-informed machine learning.

Without access to gradients, engineers are forced to rely on derivative-free methods (e.g., parameter sweeps, heuristics, or surrogate models without sensitivity guidance), which scale poorly and often miss optimal solutions in high-dimensional design spaces. This bottleneck has hindered progress in applying scalable, gradient-based optimization methods—now common in aerospace, robotics, and machine learning—to the marine energy sector.

This workshop introduces MarineHydro.jl, a fully differentiable BEM solver that unlocks access to exact sensitivities of hydrodynamic coefficients through reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Developed in Julia, MarineHydro.jl supports both direct and indirect BEM formulations and includes fast and accurate Green's function implementations. The workshop is targeted at researchers and practitioners working on design and control of offshore and marine structures, with an emphasis on applications where sensitivity information is essential. Participants will learn to install the solver, perform hydrodynamic simulations, extract gradients, and apply these results to practical case studies.

We begin by reviewing the fundamentals of differentiable programming and its potential usage/implementation in BEM software common in marine hydrodynamics.
