## Project Overview

**We propose to architect a system that integrates eVTOLs in emergency medical services to ensure affordability, performance, and equity.** The technical, operational, and regulatory requirements of the EMS services are fundamentally different and stringent from the air-taxi requirements, thus a design of system architecture is important. The successful integration of the air ambulance in the city emergency services will save countless lives by reducing the response time and safe transportation.

## Project Scope

The scope of the project is to successfully realize an integrated system of air transport for emergency medical services. It will develop models and methods necessary to deploy emergency services using the appropriate air vehicle in the urban environment. We will simulate the operational and design decisions to enumerate the architectures. 

The main function of this system is transporting (process) a patient (operand) or providing immediate medical attention (process) to the hospital (operand). Our goal is to provide insight for all the stakeholders about the promise and potential of eVTOL-based emergency services and propose several reference architectures.
