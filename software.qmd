::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}
#### [MarineHydro.jl](https://github.com/symbiotic-engineering/MarineHydro.jl)
A Boundary Element Method (BEM) solver written in Julia, designed for hydrodynamic analysis within a fully differentiable programming paradigm. It leverages automatic differentiation for efficient gradient computation.

::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}
#### MDO Framework for WECs
An open-source framework built on OpenMDAO for the Multidisciplinary Design Optimization of Wave Energy Converters (WECs). This project integrates hydrodynamic, structural, and control system models.
