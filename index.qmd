**About Me**  

I am a doctoral candidate at Cornell University, specializing in systems design, engineering, and optimization. My work focuses on leveraging computational modeling, high-performance computing (HPC), and interdisciplinary approaches to advance sustainable technologies. As a member of the Symbiotic Engineering and Analysis (SEA) Lab, I collaborate on developing innovative solutions for offshore systems to support the Blue Economy and combat climate change.  

Highlights of my experience include:  
- **Researcher and PhD Candidate**: Advancing knowledge in multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) and computational hydrodynamics.  
- **Graduate Internships**: At Sandia National Laboratories, I worked on differentiable hydrodynamics using Julia for PDE-constrained optimization.  
- **Teaching Assistant**: Supported the MDO course at Cornell, focusing on integrating creativity and rigorous optimization methodologies to design complex engineering systems.  
- **ATPESC Trainee**: Selected for the prestigious Argonne Training Program on Extreme-Scale Computing, where I honed skills in cutting-edge computational science.  
- **Industry Experience**: As a data analyst at Fastenal, I developed quantitative models to drive business decisions.  

With a Master's degree in Systems Engineering and ongoing PhD work, I aim to bridge theory and application, fostering sustainable engineering solutions through computational innovation.
